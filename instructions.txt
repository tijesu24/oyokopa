To install and use OyoKopa, you need:
Wampserver 2.X upwards
extract the zip file to the localhost "www" directory first
inside the "prettyphotos" navigate to "scripts" you will notice an sql script called "oyokopaDB"
open up your browser and navigate to phpmyadmin,
create a database called "photoprettify"
when on the database, navigate to import, then select the "oyokopaDB" sql script and load it up there
after this is done, navigate to "http//:localhost/oyokopa/" you should see the home page of the application 
enjoy!!!
 Cheers :)
